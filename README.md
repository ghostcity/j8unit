# j8unit
Enhancement for JUnit to take advantage of Java 8.

# j8unit Repository
Currently, we work hard on a j8unit test interface repository.
Once it is finished, we want to provide reusable test for any accessible method of any class, enum, interface, or annotation of JDK 8.

Until now, any SDK 8 type has an according dummy j8unit test interface.
The first repository release is coming soon and will provide few basic test methods.

After the first repository release, we want to invite others to help us increasing the test coverage by providing implementations of the dummy test methods.

*If you are interested in helping, come back in January 2016. We will provide any required information to get your code into j8unit repository.*
